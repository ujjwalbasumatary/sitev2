I have an interest in art since my childhood and used to spend a lot of time making sketches and paintings. I cannot afford to spend a lot of time on art any more but whenever I need a break I like to doodle. I have previously used pencils, charcoal, acrylics, watercolor and oil-based paint for my art. Nowadays, I have started exploring digital art. I recently purchased Procreate from Apple store.
