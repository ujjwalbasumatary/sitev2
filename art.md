<div class="custom-padding">
<p> I have an interest in art since my childhood and used to spend a lot of time making sketches and paintings. I cannot afford to spend a lot of time on art any more but whenever I need a break I like to doodle. I have previously used pencils, charcoal, acrylics, watercolor and oil-based paint for my art. Nowadays, I have started exploring digital art. I recently purchased Procreate from Apple store.

<p> The painting on the left was the first 'proper' one that I made using Procreate. IISc's <i> Sharodiya Durgotsab Comittee </i> invited submissions for their magazine and I thought it would be a nice way to relax. I didn't read their email carefully which had clearly asked for b/w drawings. I had to apply a b/w filter to the original painting and was initially a bit disappointed but the final product turned out not so bad. <img src="/images/UjjwalDurgaPujav2bandw.png" style="float: right; padding: 30px;" width = "283px" height = "400px"/></p>
