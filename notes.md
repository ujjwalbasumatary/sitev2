<title>Notes</title>
<div class="custom-padding">
This section has my notes for various topics that I learnt through books and lectures. They are very terse and mostly intended for my own reference. Nevertheless, I am uploading my notes in the unlikely event that they are useful to someone.
<ul><li><a href="#">String theory notes</a>: I am tring to work through Polchinski's two volume classic. These mostly contain details of calculations and my solutions to exercises.</li>
<li><a href="#">AdS3/CFT2 correspondence</a>: These are notes made for the course titled <i>HE380: 3D Quantum Gravity and 2D CFT</i> offered during fall 2024 by Prof. Chethan Krishnan.</li>
<li><a href="#">Many-body field theory</a>: These notes were made for the course <i>PH380: Non-equilibrium many-body quantum dynamics</i> offered by Prof. Sumilan Banerjee at IISc.</li>
<li><a href="#">Algebraic QFT</a>: I studied some AQFT from the two reviews written by Fewster and Rejznia and another by Witten.</li>
<li><a href="#">QFT-1</a>: These notes were prepared from the QFT-1 course taught at ICTS-TIFR by Prof. Suvrat Raju.</li>
<li><a href="#">QFT-2</a>: These notes were prepared from the QFT-2 course taught at ICTS-TIFR by Prof. Ashoke Sen.</li>
