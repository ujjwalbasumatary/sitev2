				<h1> About me </h1>
				<p>Hi! My name is Ujjwal. I am a BS-MS student at IISc, Bengaluru expected to graduate in spring 2024. I
					have an
					interest in high-energy theory, more specifically QFT, CFT, string theory and holography. Apart from
					that I
					also have an interest in particle phenomenology.</p>
				<p> This website is mostly intended to be a repository of the notes made during my studies and projects.
					Feel
					free to use my notes but be warned that they may be full of typos!
				<h1> What I am currently reading </h1>
				<ul>
					<li> Polchinski's two-volume text on string theory.</li>
					<li> Algebraic QFT from Haag's text and notes by Witten, Fewster and Rezjnia. </li>
					<li> CFT by di Francesco et. al. </li>
				</ul>
