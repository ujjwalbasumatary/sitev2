	<h1> About me </h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Ujjwal. I am a BS-MS student at IISc, Bengaluru expected to graduate in spring 2024. I have an interest in high-energy theory, more specifically QFT, CFT, string theory and holography. Apart from that I also have an interest in particle phenomenology.</p>
	<p> This website is mostly intended to be a repository of the notes made during my studies and projects. Feel free to use my notes but be warned that they may be full of typos!
	<h1> What I am currently reading </h1>
	<ul>
		<li> Polchinski's two-volume text on string theory.</li>
		<li> Trying to teach myself some algebraic QFT from Haag's text and notes by Witten. </li>
		<li> CFT by di Francesco et. al. </li>
	</ul>
